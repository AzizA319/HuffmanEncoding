Project description:

Huffman encoding is a compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies.
More frequently used characters receive shorter codes, reducing overall data size. 
This lossless compression method is widely used in file compression and transmission to optimize data storage and transfer.


To run the project please do the following:
1. place all the files in the same directory
2. run DictionaryTests.js for the test suite for the dictionay class
3. run Main.js to get the output file for hamlet.txt (i.e hamlet.txt.huff)
4. change the filename to the desired filename in the main method of the main.js file
5. Feel free to try it with other .txt files
